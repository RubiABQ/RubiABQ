Repository for RubiABQ, the Albuquerque Ruby group.

# RubiABQ, the users group

RubiABQ is for anyone interested in the Ruby programming language.
Our physical meetings are in Albuquerque and those typically include
presentations geared toward programmers, but everyone is welcome to
join.

RubiABQ has been meeting continuously since 2009, but we've only
recently focused on planning ahead and sharing what we've previously
presented.  We have, however, been on
[Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Rubyists-in-Albuquerque/) since 2010,
which at least provides a minimal historical record.

# RubiABQ, this repository

This repository gives our members an easy way to see what we're doing
and what we've done.

## How to contribute

### Attend
Show up.  [Our meetings](https://www.meetup.com/Rubyists-in-Albuquerque/events/)
are on the second Wednesday of the month, at 6pm
at [Ideas and Coffee](https://www.ideasandcoffee.com/).  Free pizza and beverages are supplied.

If you can, please RSVP affirmatively as soon as you know you're going to
show up. That will encourage others to do the same and we'll have a nice upward spiral.

### Present

Have you done something that may be interesting to others? Please present.  Let us know
how long you need and which month or months are good candidates and we'll do our best
to schedule you.
