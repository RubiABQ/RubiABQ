There was no prepared presentation, at least not with slides.
However, Cliff had scoured [Hacker
News](https://news.ycombinator.com/news) earlier in the day and that
got him talking about
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) in general,
using GitHub for simple web pages (e.g., a [Pizza
recipe](https://github.com/hendricius/pizza-dough)) and Arne Hillman's
[markdeck](https://arnehilmann.github.io/markdeck/).

# Markdeck for February
Cliff will present a reprise of his "Talking to one's self" presentation
at our [February 13th meeting](https://www.meetup.com/Rubyists-in-Albuquerque/events/zqfxjpyzdbrb/).

# Retroactive Markdeck for January (maybe)
